## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Click to place start point, end point, and barriers.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch the A* algorithm explore the grid and find the shortest path.
- **Path Highlighting**: Displays the final path in a distinct color after computation.
- **Reset & Modify Grid**: Remove nodes or reset the entire grid to try different scenarios.
